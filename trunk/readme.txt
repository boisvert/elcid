How to install

el-cid runs online from a website. it is written in PHP with a mySQL database

the site has no auto installation. To install your version

- database/ contains an SQL export of the DB

- htdocs/ contain the system
- config/ for passwords and such
- tutorials/ contains a few examples of tutorials showing how to make more

- ready/ contains a batch file that copies the files in the right places for a site structure. Site gets created in the same ready/ directory, to take to your server. The tutorials get copied to a users/samples/ subdirectory and registered users save their tutorials to a users/<username/ directory when the site is running.

- I have a running version of the site at http://www.boisvert.me.uk/ . If you create your own site, you are welcome to fork this project to share your adaptation. If you are considering hosting tutorials, tutorials you make can be excluded from the GPL (so you can continue owning them, etc.).
