eL-CID is software intended to explain the programming process using computer animation.

You can see it working: http://www.boisvert.me.uk

It is made up of three tools:
  * A player for animations
  * A web site of web programming examples (primarily HTML and Javascript)
  * Tools to make new animations.

The visualisation tool uses an XML file with the computer programâ€™s editing history, and shows the iterative development dynamically, as if code was being edited in front of the learner.

The web site supported by a database presents the available tutorials. Several example tutorials are available in the source available here.

Finally, an editing tool supports the composition of development descriptions.
