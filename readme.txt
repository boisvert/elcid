How to install

el-cid runs online from a website. it is written in PHP with a mySQL database

the site has no auto installation. To install your version

- database/ contains an SQL export of the DB
- htdocs/ contain the system, including
   - tutorials/users/samples
             contains a few examples of tutorials showing how to make more.
             When the site is running, users who register to add tutorials
             get a folder by their username under users/

- I have a running version of the site at http://www.boisvert.me.uk/ . If you create your own site, you are welcome to fork this project to share your adaptation. If you are considering hosting tutorials, tutorials you make can be excluded from the GPL (so you can continue owning them, etc.).
