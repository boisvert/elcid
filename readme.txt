eL-CID - e-Learning by Communicating Iterative Development

Readme
======

Thank you for downloading!


To run, you have two options:

- Use with a web server and PHP/MySQL. In that case:

1. Unzip the complete set of files in your htdocs folder
   (or a subfolder you make).

2. Make a MySQL database for your server. run the two SQL scripts in the database/ folder to set the structure and populate it.

3. Configure the variables in htdocs/security.php

4. You should now be able to view examples, but also use the example editor on a server of your own.

- Alternatively, use a client only subset of the system. To do so, unzip the run/ folder in htdocs. Open elcid.html to view tutorials.


The samples folder contains example XML files to help demonstrate code development. If you make your own XML examples, save them in the same folder - this is the folder that the system loads from.

eL-CID has been tested on Mozilla 1.4, Safari 1.2, Internet Explorer 5.5 and later.

The licensing of eL-CID is open source except that you may create your own development examples and exploit them commercially - see the source for details. The XML examples included are in the public domain.
